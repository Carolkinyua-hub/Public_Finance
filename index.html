						<h5 class="title">Our Motivation</h5>
						<p>Bondarenko(n.d) describes a debt crisis as a situation where a country is unable to pay back its Government Debt.</p>
						<p>This comes about when tax revenues of its Government are less that expenditures for a prolonged period.</p>
						<p>The expectation is that Government ought to sufficiently finance expenditures by raising money through taxation.</p>
						<p>However, when tax revenues are not sufficient , the government can make up the difference by issuing debt by selling treasury bills in an open market to investors.</p>
					        <p>Bondarenko goes ahead to assert that if the Government is able to make good of its payments its not difficult for it to find investors willing to lend it money.</p>
						<p>However if the burden of debt becomes huge , investors worry about the ability to pay back and thereby demand high interest rates to cushion themselves against the high risk lending.</p>
						<p>This increased worry by investors may intensify thereby leading to a vicious cycle of increased cost of lending and could penultimately increase the probability of the country defaulting on existing debt and ultimately entering a debt crisis.</p>

						<h5 class="title">The twist</h5>
						<p>Upon performing an independent two sample t-test to test statistical significance of the year on increase in Public Expenditure vs Revenue over time ,at a p.value of 0.8332177677606009.</p>
						<p>The year on increase isn't statistically significant to say that we are living beyond our means</p>
						<p>We are conflicted though because the deficits and the debt values are exponentially increasing and there exists a huge disparity as well as seen in the graphs.</p>
						<p>The deficit is: Ksh. 38,072,661 Billion</p>
					        <p>The total debt is: Ksh.700,172,291 Billions</p>
						<p>The difference between The Total_Debt and Deficit is: 662,099,630 Billion Shillings</p>
						<p>Debt to GDP ratio has risen sharply from 39.8% in 2013 to 68.4% in 2021. It is projected that the ratio will be 71% by the end of 2023. </p>
						<p>A high debt-to-GDP ratio is undesirable for a country, as a higher ratio indicates a higher risk of default. In a study conducted by the World Bank, a ratio that exceeds 77% for an extended period of time may result in an adverse impact on economic growth. It was indicated that each additional percentage point of debt above that level reduced annual real growth by 1.7%. For reference, the USAâ€™s debt-to-GDP ratio was 105.40% in 2017. Therefore, when the ratio is high (>80%), a country is likely to exhibit a slowdown in economic growth.</p>
						<p>From we mere Mortals: Brian Mutugi, Cosmas Gitonga, Calvince Onyango and Nyaguthii Kinyua, our statistical exploits continue.
					        <p>However if you have more clues, our ears are wide open.............<p>
